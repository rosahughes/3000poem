#A Little Budding Rose

:rose:

    _By Emily Bronte_

    It was a little budding *rose* <br>
    Round like a fairy globe,<br>
    And shyly did its leaves unclose<br>
    Hid in their mossy robe,<br>
    But sweet was the slight and spicy smell<br>
    It breathed from its heart invisible.<br>
    
    The *rose* is blasted, withered, blighted,<br>
    Its root has felt a worm,<br>
    And like a heart beloved and slighted,<br>
    Failed, faded, shrunk its form.<br>
    Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,<br>
    I stole thee from thy natal bower.<br>

    I was the worm that withered thee,<br>
    Thy tears of dew all fell for me;<br>
    Leaf and stalk and *rose* are gone,<br>
    Exile earth they died upon.<br>
    Yes, that last breath of balmy scent<br>
    With alien breezes sadly blent!<br>
