# A Little Budding Rose

:rose:


_By Emily Bronte_

It was a little budding __rose__ <br>
Round like a fairy globe,<br>
And shyly did its leaves unclose<br>
Hid in their mossy robe,<br>
But sweet was the slight and spicy smell<br>
It breathed from its heart invisible.<br>

The __rose__ is blasted, withered, blighted,<br>
Its root has felt a worm,<br>
And like a heart beloved and slighted,<br>
Failed, faded, shrunk its form.<br>
Bud of beauty, bonnie flower,<br>
I stole thee from thy natal bower.<br>

I was the worm that withered thee,<br>
Thy tears of dew all fell for me;<br>
Leaf and stalk and __rose__ are gone,<br>
Exile earth they died upon.<br>
Yes, that last breath of balmy scent<br>
With alien breezes sadly blent!<br>
